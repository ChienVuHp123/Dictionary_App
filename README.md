# Dictionary_App

 The code starts by creating a URL object.
 The URL object is then passed to the HttpURLConnection class, which creates an HTTP connection with the Translate API.
 Next, it sets up a User-Agent header for the request and sends in some text that will be translated into another language.
 Finally, it reads through all of the lines in response and prints them out on screen one at a time.
 The code is used to call the Google Translate API and parse the result.
